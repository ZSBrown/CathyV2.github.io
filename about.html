        <h2 class="bio">Author, Educator, Chemist, Alchemist!</h2>
    <p class="bio">
                Since turning seventeen during the Summer of Love, I've been a waitress,
secretary, cook, clerk, hippie, hitchhiker, bartender, dancer, teacher,
truck farmer, and mom. In between, I graduated from Reed College, rode my
        Harley, and reported on the Motorcycle Rally in Sturgis for <em>Easyriders</em>.
And through it all, I've been a writer because I love telling stories.
<br>
    <br>    
        As a kid, I told stories to teachers, neighbors, strangers–anybody who would listen. I started sending stories to magazines–and collecting rejection slips–when I was twelve, and finally, in my late thirties, I sold my first story to <em>Easyriders</em>, a biker magazine.
<br>
    <br>    
Five years later, after selling 20 short stories to biker magazines, I signed the contract for my first full-length book. Surprise! It wasn’t about bikers; it was a history of chemistry. You see, between the ages of 30 and 38 I decided I needed a day job. I went back to school and ended up with a PhD in chemistry from USCB. Hey, you never know . . .
<br>
    <br>    
Now, in my sixties, with five books about chemistry under my belt, I have returned to my roots. I am writing fiction, but my biker days are done. A bit closer to the grave, I’m writing suspense and horror and having a ghoulishly good time. Linda Muse, who is responsible for the creepy cover art for my short stories, encouraged me to incorporate the history of chemistry in my fiction because, believe it or not, there are some pretty lively–and deadly–characters in chemistry.
<br>
    <br>    
So there you have it, my life. It’s time for me to get back to writing stories so I can share them with you. I hope you buy them, enjoy them, and pass on my name. I hope they amuse you and encourage you. Finally, I hope that you, too, have a long and interesting and eccentric life!</p>
