    If you are a Ph.D. chemist, why did you bother to write a book about alchemy? Isn’t it just “fake science?”</p>

    Good question. My coauthors and I decided to write The Chemistry of Alchemy because we found our intellectual ancestors, the alchemists, to be passionate, freewheeling visionaries who were willing to risk the gallows, prostitute their intellect, and impoverish themselves and their families for the sake of a dream—and we wanted to know why. Why did they think they could make gold, and what kept them at their fires failure after failure?</p>

    Good answer as far as it goes, but couldn’t you just read the alchemists’ writings and find out what made them tick?</p>

    We studied the writings of alchemists, of course, but we quickly learned the answer would not come from words or old engravings. The overriding principle of alchemy was secrecy. Understandably. If you thought you had figured out how to make gold from lead and donkey dung, would you want to tell the world?</p>

    If you couldn’t trust what the alchemists wrote, how could you research alchemy?</p>

    Like good chemists, we tried to create demonstrations of alchemical procedures, which led to substantial problems. We found recipes, recopied by medieval scribes, with errors or omissions. We found several different ingredients with the same name and several names for the same ingredient. We found frustrating poetic descriptions rather than step-wise procedures and ironically, as a result, we succeeded in our quest to experience what the alchemists experienced: we spent hours over boiling beakers, tried many methods that didn’t work, reasoned, guessed, and then finally threw everything in the pot out of desperation—took deep breaths and regrouped, returned to the books, searched for hints and explanations—and finally, after many fruitless hours—experienced moments of glorious success.</p>

    Me again. How can I know that you had real success and not “fake” success? To repeat, alchemy is not chemistry.</p>

The heart of The Chemistry of Alchemy lies in 20 demonstrations that you can do—carefully—in a reasonably well equipped kitchen or workshop. You can reenactment of alchemical practices including growing gold and silver trees; producing the philosophers’ stone, complete with peacock’s tail; and, of course,
    transmutation. You will experience the magic that kept the alchemists at their fires: the love of the smell, the smoke, the heat, the fumes, the foam, the fizz, the colors, and the gleam—the love of chemistry, which we love too.</p>
